points2grid release notes

Version 1.0.2: 

Version 1.0.2 of Points2Grid is a minor release, adding several small
features to the prior 1.0.1 release. These include:

* A compile-time option to align grids to the origin (0,0): Grids can now
be aligned to origin, or to the lower-left corner of the dataset as in
previous releases.

* A compile-time option to set an upper-bound on grid size: Out-of-core
operations have the possibility of exhausting all available disk space
and crashing, with sufficiently high resolutions and large datasets. A
suitable upper-limit on the number of grid points allowed in output can
provide protection from this. With this option enabled, when the
calculated grid size exceeds the pre-determined limit, Points2Grid will
abort.

* Support for libLAS 1.7+: Support for libLAS 1.7+, using the libLAS C
API, has been back-ported from the CRREL fork of Points2Grid. Support for
libLAS 1.2.1 and earlier through the native C++ API continues to be
available as a compile-time option.

Version 1.0.1:

Version 1.0.1 of Points2Grid is a minor release, adding to the prior 1.0 release. 
Through the 1.0.1 release, Points2Grid is now available under an updated 4-clause BSD 
license.

Version 1.0:

* Input point clouds in ASCII and LAS formats
* Outputs in Arc ASCII and GRD ASCII formats
* DEM products including min, max, mean, and idw values
* Point count values for every grid cell
* Configurable search radius and grid resolution
* Null filling, using a configurable moving window, to fill cells that have
  null values
