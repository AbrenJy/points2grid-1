PREREQUISITES
-------------
Points2Grid requires the following to be installed -

1) curl: Please install libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 7.20.0 of libcurl.

2) liblas: Please install liblas from http://liblas.org. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 1.2.1 and 1.7+ of liblas.

3)gcc version 3.X. This Makefile doesn't work with GCC4.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Please adjust the MEM_LIMIT variable in the Interpolation.h file to reflect
the memory limitations of your system. As a rule of thumb, set the
MEM_LIMIT to be (available memory in bytes)/55. For jobs that generate
grids cells greater than the MEM_LIMIT, points2grid goes "out-of-core",
resulting in significantly worse performance. Set the upper-bound on grid size in the MAKEFILE and modify the Makefile to point to your installation.

COMPILATION
-----------

If you have installed curl and liblas at non-standard locations, please set
your CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH to respectively point to the
locations of the include files and libraries of the installed software
pre-requisites.

If you are on a Mac (OSX), edit the Makefile to uncomment the Mac-specific
CFLAGS setting. If you are on Solaris or Linux, there is no need to update
the Makefile.

To compile points2grid, simply use the Makefile by typing "make". The
Makefile has been confirmed to work with gcc3 on Linux, Solaris and OSX.
