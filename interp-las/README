Make sure that you have gcc version 3.X. This Makefile doesn't work with
GCC4. I also had to comment out the "ctags" target for the Makefile to
work. To compile, simply type "make" from the command-line.

As a prerequisite, you need to install libcurl from: http://curl.haxx.se/,
and liblas from: http://liblas.org. Be sure to modify the Makefile to point
to your installation.
